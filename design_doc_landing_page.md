# AxionFlow B2B Landing Page - CTO Edition

## Core Philosophy
**Engineering First. AI Second.**
Target Audience: CTOs, VPs of Engineering, Lead Architects.
Goal: Establish trust through technical rigor, not marketing hype.

## 1. Structure & Flow

1.  **Hero Section**: Immediate Value Proposition. No fluff.
    *   *Headline*: "Deterministic LLM Systems for Enterprise."
    *   *Sub*: "We replace probabilistic guesswork with structural engineering. Audit, Architecture, and Repair."
2.  **The Threat (Reality Check)**: Why they need us.
    *   Black Box Liability.
    *   Technical Debt Velocity.
    *   Compliance Risks.
3.  **The Mechanism (Methodology/Engine)**: Proof of competence.
    *   "Powered by AxionFlow Engine."
    *   Explain the pipeline: Analyze -> Plan -> Execute -> Validate.
    *   *Visual*: Terminal output or rigorous flowchart.
4.  **The Architect (Technical Ownership)**: The human guarantee.
    *   **Position**: High visibility. "I assume technical responsibility."
    *   *Bio*: Kelvin Moraes, Principal Engineer.
5.  **The Offering (Services)**: Specifications, not "packages".
    *   *Audit*: AST Analysis, Traceability Matrix.
    *   *Architecture*: Containerized Pipelines, Local-First CD.
6.  **CTA**: Direct access to engineering.

## 2. Copy Improvements (Direct & Technical)

### Hero
"Stop gambling with probability. Start engineering with certainty."

### Services
Instead of generic bullet points, use "Deliverables":
*   **Audit**: "Deliverable: AST-based Dependency Graph of your Prompt Chains."
*   **Architecture**: "Deliverable: Self-hosted Orchestration Layer (No Vendor Lock-in)."

## 3. Design Guidelines
*   **Typography**: `JetBrains Mono` for all data-heavy text. `Inter` for narrative.
*   **Layout**: High density, grid-based, visible borders (`border-white/10`).
*   **Contrast**: Stark. `#0F1115` background, `#EAEAEA` text, `#3B82F6` (Blue) for logic, `#F59E0B` (Amber) for warnings.
*   **No**: Gradients, rounded corners (use sharp edges), stock photos.

## 4. Quality Checklist (CTO Perspective)
- [ ] Is the "Black Box" problem defined in terms of *business risk*?
- [ ] Is the solution proposed as *infrastructure*, not magic?
- [ ] Is the technical leadership visible and accountable?
- [ ] Are the deliverables concrete (artifacts, code, reports)?
- [ ] Is there zero marketing fluff?
